## Instructions

To access my landing page, clone or download the files in the repository, P2-Landing-Page. Then, drag the index.html file into your browser. Click on the different sections in the navigation bar at the top of the page to see my work in action.

## Starting-state

This starter project began with some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project which was provided by Udacity. 

## Modifications

I added a JavaScript file to modify the HTML and CSS.

Specifically I...
1. linked a JavaScript file to the index.html.
2. added JavaScript to dynamically add a navigation bar to the page top. The JavaScript grabbed the section names and put them in the navigation bar.
3. used listeners on each section name in the navigation bar. When a section name is clicked on, the window scrolls to that section.
4. determined which section is closest to the top of the window, marked that section as active and used JavaScript to change the CSS, highlighting the active section. 
5. dynamically change the highlighted "active" section as the user scrolls or if the JavaScript initiates the scroll when the user clicks on a section name in the navigation bar.
